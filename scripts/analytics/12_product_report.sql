Product Report
======================================
Purpose:
-This report consolidates key product metrics and behaviours.

Highlights:
1. Gathers essential fields such as product name, category, subcategory, and cost.
2. Segments products by revenue to identify high-performers, mid-range, or low-performers.
3. Aggregates product-level metrics:
-Total orders
-total sales
-total quantity sold
-total customers (unique)
-lifespan (in months)
4. Calculates valuable KPIs:
-recency (months since last sale)
-average order revenue (AOR)
-average monthly revenue
